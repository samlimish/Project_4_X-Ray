## Business Problem

Due to a shortage of staff and doctors through COVID-19, the St.Jude Children's Hospital wants to use A.I. to diagnose pneumonia through x-ray images of children's lungs. The goal of this project is to use convolution neural network for computer vision to detect pneumonia from x-ray images.
